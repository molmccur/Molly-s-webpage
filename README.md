# TM1 – Basic HTML Page

This is a super simple HTML page I made to practice using tags like `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, `<style>`, and `<body>`. It’s got a title, a heading, a subheading, and two paragraphs with some basic styling (background colors and font colors).

## How to open it:
Just open the `index.html` file in any browser, or check out the live version if it's hosted.

That's pretty much it!
