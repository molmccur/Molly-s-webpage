    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p>
      I'm Molly McCurdy, a student at IU studying Environmental Science. I am from Fairbanks, Alaska. I have two dogs, a corgi named Winnetka and a weiner dog named Phillip. I am excited to take this class as I have never done anything like this before.

     I think this is super cool. I didn't even know what computation was when I signed up for this class, I just knew it was a requirment for my major lol. I look forward to the rest of the course.
